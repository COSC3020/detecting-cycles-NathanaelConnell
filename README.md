# Detecting Cycles in Graphs

Kruskal's Algorithm adds edges to the minimum spanning tree, unless they would
add a cycle. In the lectures, we did not talk about how to do this -- you're
going to implement a function to detect cycles in a graph. Start with the
template I provided in `code.js`. You can use any data structures (i.e. any
graph representation) you like. The function should return `true` or `false`,
depending on whether the given graph contains a cycle or not.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

I had ai and other github assigmnets to help make the test code, and help with troublshooting the test case of no cycle and test case 3.

The worst cas big theta complexity of my implementation depends on the structure of the graph.  When there are edges the runtime is dominated by the  number of edges making it big theta (m), where m is the number of edges.  The union find operations(with path compression and union by rank) are effectively constant time for most operations, so the overall complexity is proportional to the number of edges processed.  In the special case where there are no edges however the runtime is dominated by the initialization of the union find data structure, which involves iterating over all n nodes, making the runtime big theta (n).  So the complexity reflects both cases of big theta (n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.
